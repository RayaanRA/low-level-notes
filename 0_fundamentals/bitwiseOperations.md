# Bitwise Operations
**Definition**  
Bitwise operations are a set of operations done on a binary string that compares and manipulate the individual bits.  

## Bitwise AND
For two inputs, each bit will be compared and will return 1 only if both bits are 1.

| A | B | Output |  
| :-: | :-: | :-: |  
| 0 | 0 | 0 |  
| 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |  
| 1 | 1 | 1 |   

## Bitwise OR
Returns 1 if either input includes a 1.

| A | B | Output |  
| :-: | :-: | :-: |  
| 0 | 0 | 0 |  
| 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |  
| 1 | 1 | 1 |
